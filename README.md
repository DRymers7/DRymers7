### Hello! My name is Derek. ðŸ‘‹

I subscribe to the philosophy of embracing curiosity.

Whether it be breaking down business problems into different components that could be solved with data analysis and inferential statistics, or deciphering the illusion surrounding the software structure of an application that does not yet exist, I always find myself investigating new ways to satiate my curiosity. 

This philosophy led me down a path to learn about data science, machine learning, and finally software development, and the eclectic tools and languages that build the technological infrastructure of our society. 

Pursuing a career in software development has led me to study at Tech Elevator, learning about full-stack development, agile methodology, and numerous other technical skills that have helped me jumpstart my career transition. Combined with my prior experience, I have discovered a capacity to bring a unique, data-driven perspective to teams, along with a robust technical skillset and the drive to not only operate in a fast-paced startup environment, but to elevate the efforts of those around me as well. 

Now, I am looking for an opportunity to bring the skills I have learned through my professional career to a new team, to both construct and optimize the product, but also educate, advocate for and motivate those who are committed to the shared vision.
